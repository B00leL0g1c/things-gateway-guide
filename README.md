# Things Gateway by Mozilla

This respository is being used to develop user documentation on how to set up and operate a Things Gateway. The project was initiated and is being led by the Mozilla IoT team, but all are welcome to participate, since the framework is open source, and the development activity is performed openly using communications tools such as IRC, Discourse, and Github issues lists.

Note: although this guide provides setup information assuming the gateway image is installed on a Raspberry Pi, the main steps for setup and most steps thereafter are platform agnostic.
